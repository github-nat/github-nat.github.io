					<p><h2>EXPLORE THE IDENTITY SYSTEM</h2></p>
					<p><h1>Our identity system is integral to our brand. It is responsible for creating a systematic visual language that compliments the brand mark. The system is comprised of many devices useful for creating flexibility, consistency and unity across applications. </h1></p>

					<p><h2>TYPOGRAPHY</h2></p>
					<p><h1>Typography plays a major role in shaping our brand. To create a consistent, engaging identity across all print applications, two standard families of typefaces were selected: Regular New and Din.</h1></p>

					<p><h3>Personality typeface</h3></p>
					<p><h4>Our personality typeface is <span>Regular New</span>. The two weights for use are Regular New Bold and Light. This typeface is primarily used for headings.</h4></p>
					
					<img src="#">
					<p><h5><figcaption>Regular New</figcaption></h5></p>

					<p><h3>Primary typeface</h3></p>
					<p><h4>Our primary typeface is <span>Din</span>. It can be used in four different weights: Light, Regular, Medium and Bold. This typeface is reserved for body copy.</h4></p>
					
					<img src="#">
					<p><h5><figcaption>Din</figcaption></h5></p>

					<p><h3>Web typeface</h3></p>
					<p><h4><span>Exo 2</span> is used for web communications.</h4></p>
					
					<img src="#">
					<p><h5><figcaption>EXO2</figcaption></h5></p>

					<p><h3>System typeface</h3></p>
					<p><h4><span>Arial</span> is used in all  MS Offices documents including email communication.</h4></p>

					<p><h2>COLOUR PALETTE</h2></p>
					<p><h1>Colour plays an important role in the Transurban visual identity and accurate representation is essential. Each colour has a corresponding reference for print (Pantone and CMYK) and digital (RGB) applications.</h1></p>

					<p><h3>Primary colour palette</h3></p>
					<p><h4>The primary colour palette consists of TU green, TU black and TU grey.</h4></p>
				
					<img src="#">

					<p><h3>Tonal palette</h3></p>
					<p><h4>The tonal palette of TU green and TU grey is reserved for the graphic element.</h4></p>  

					<img src="#">

					<p><h3>Secondary colour palette</h3></p>
					<p><h4>A secondary colour palette has been developed or use where a greater rangef of colours is required e.g. charts and diagrams.</h4></p>

					<p><h2>GRAPHIC ELEMENT</h2></p>
					<p><h1>Inspired by the <span>curve of the road</span> symbol in the brand mark, the core linear graphic element captures the idea of connection and continuity. It is available in a range of two colour and single colour versions.</h1></p>

					<p><h3>Two-tone colour use</h3></p>
					<p><h4>Use only on a duotone image (black and PMS417). This provides the best contrast and visibility of the graphic element.</h4></p>
				
					<img src="#">

					<p><h3>Keyline white use</h3></p>
					<p><h4>This version is applied to full colour imagery with an 80 per cent transparency.</h4></p>
					
					<img src="#">

					<p><h3>Cropping and extending</h3></p> 
					<p><h4>Always ensure you capture both ends of the graphic element to fully communicate the idea of a journey and connection. It is also possible to extend or contract the width of the element while retaining the end curves.</h4></p>

					<img src="#">

					<p><h3>Scale contrast</h3></p>
					<p><h4>The full and cropped version of the graphic element can be combined as a flat graphic when photography is not required or relevant. This version uses scale contrast to achieve depth and visual interest.</h4></p>

					<img src="#">

					<p><h3>Flipping</h3></p>
					<p><h4>Flipping the graphic element horizontally can assist in creating an orientation to suit your layout. Rotating is not permitted.</h4></p>

					<p><h2>PHOTOGRAPHY</h2></p>
					<p><h1>Photography plays a vital role in conveying our brand personality to our customers and stakeholders, capturing the dynamic and changeable environment in which we operate. The collection is made up of three categories: hero (asset), dynamic movement and community.</h1></p> 

					<p><h3>Hero (asset)</h3></p>
					<p><h4>Our hero (asset) photography features the scale and dramatic presence of road infrastructure assets. Reproduced in colour or duotones of TU black and TU grey the effect is bold, textural and refined.</h4></p>

					<img src="#">

					<p><h3>Dynamic movement</h3></p>
					<p><h4>This collection emphasises smooth movement and fast connections by adopting a slow-shutter speed effect.</h4></p>
					
					<img src="#">

					<p><h3>Driver experience</h3></p>
					<p><h4>The driver experience imagery has been created to capture the first person experience of being behind the wheel on the Transurban road network. The imagery captures the sense of a smooth and safe journey with its dynamic visual perspective.</h4></p>

					<img src="#">

					<p><h3>Community</h3></p>
					<p><h4>Transurban is passionate about positively impacting the communities in which we operate. This involvement is evidenced by an extensive collection of portraits and descriptive imagery representing our projects and community engagement. Reproduced in full colour or black and white overlaid with bold colours from the secondary colour palette the effect is engaging and dynamic.</h4></p>
